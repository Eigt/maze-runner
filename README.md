Maze Runner is a simple Unity game I made from scratch as an assignment. 
It features a procedurally generated simple underground maze containing three rooms.
Each room contains a key needed to open the exit.
Upon first entering any room, an enemy is spawned that deterministically visits the entire maze until it is destroyed.
The player can shoot a projectile in the direction they are "facing" to destroy enemies.
The game is over once the player exits the maze and reaches the flagpole above ground.
